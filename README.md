[h1]Legion Overhaul[/h1]

Completely changes how legions earn distinctions. RNG has been removed, and now legions grow organically based on unit composition, geography, and consistently winning.

Almost all previous distinctions have been removed from the game. The remaining default ones have been rebalanced so that legions no longer have an inherent advantage over levies. Legions will grow more powerful through the course of the game due to their ability to drill and earn permanent distinctions. 

To earn a distinction you must win a Great Battle. To be considered a Great Battle both sides need field at least 15k men (up from 8k in vanilla).

The only exception to the Great Battle rule right now is sieges. To earn a siege distinction, simply win a siege in enemy territory with at least 20 of the same cohort type in your unit.

After winning enough battles in a row you will gain a permanent distinction bonus; however, if you lose a battle before earning that permanent bonus some progress will be lost.

Distinctions can also be gained by drilling, capped at a certain level. You will only gain distinctions you meet the requirements for; for example, you need 20 archers drilling to get archer distinctions. Similiarly, you will only gain distinctions for the terrain you are drilling on.

This MOD was developed with multiplayer balance in mind, hence some of the large values to discourage abuse. If  you're interested in Imperator multiplayer join a campaign at [url=https://discord.gg/JuPs9wUJae]Molon Labe Discord[/url]

PS: I marked this as requiring Heirs of Alexander, but it may work without it.

PSS: When using other mods, make sure to load this one first. The legion victories in legion history may not work if you use a UI mod.
