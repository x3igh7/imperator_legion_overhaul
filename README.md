# imperator_legion_overhaul

Completely changes how legions earn distinctions. RNG has been removed, and now legions grow organically based on unit composition, geography, and consistently winning.

Almost all previous distinctions have been removed from the game. The remaining default ones have been rebalanced so that legions no longer have an inherent advantage over levies. Legions will grow more powerful through the course of the game due to their ability to drill and earn permanent distinctions. 

To earn a distinction you must win a Great Battle. To be considered a Great Battle both sides need field at least 10k men (up from 8k in vanilla).

The only exception to the Great Battle rule right now is sieges. To earn a siege distinction, simply win a siege in enemy territory with at least 20 of the same cohort type in your unit.

After winning enough battles in a row you will gain a permanent distinction bonus; however, if you lose a battle before earning that permanent bonus some progress will be lost.

Future Plans:
- Allow levies to gain the same bonuses as legions (however they are destroyed when levies are disbanded).
- When drilling, gain a limited number of bonuses based on the cohorts drilling and their terrain.

This MOD was developed with multiplayer balance in mind, hence some of the large values to discourage abuse. If  you're interested in Imperator multiplayer join a campaign at Molon Labe: https://discord.gg/JuPs9wUJae

PS: I marked this as requiring Heirs of Alexander, but it may work without it.
